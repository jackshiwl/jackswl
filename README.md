# Climate Research

Most papers in well-known journals have high-level descriptions of the various methodologies and terminologies used, which I find difficulties sourcing for other simpler forms of explanations and information. This page is therefore to document websites, articles, and videos that I found useful along the way.

## Introduction to Climate Models 
These websites provide a detailed history and introduction to climate models. <br />
[[Carbon Brief] How do climate models work?](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-do-climate-models-work/) <br />
[[Carbon Brief] Timeline: The history of climate modelling](https://www.carbonbrief.org/timeline-history-climate-modelling/) <br /> 



## Reanalysis and Reforecast
These websites provide explanations to what are reforecast and reanalysis data <br />
[[ECMWF] Fact sheet: Reanalysis](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/focus/2020/fact-sheet-reanalysis#:~:text=Reanalysis%20combines%20past%20short%2Drange,system%20as%20their%20starting%20point.) <br />
[[ECMWF] Use of ERA5 reanalysis to initialise reâ€‘forecasts proves beneficial](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/newsletter/161/meteorology/use-era5-reanalysis-initialise-re-forecasts-proves-beneficial)

I found this video to be much more intuitive. In the present day, we are continuously observing the weather all over the world, and this video compares that with the filming of a football kick. In the past, weather observations were rare, which the video compares that to three different pictures of the football kick instead, and reanalysis is hence a model based on physical equations in hope of reconstructing the football trajectory using the three different pictures. <br />

> These are retrospective weather forecasts generated with a fixed numerical model. Model developers
could use them for diagnosing model bias, thereby facilitating the development of new, improved versions of the model. Others could use them as data for statistically correcting weather forecasts, thereby developing improved, user-specific products [e.g., model output statistics (MOS) Glahn and Lowry 1972; Carter et al. 1989]. Others may use them for studies of atmospheric predictability. Unfortunately, extensive sets of reforecasts are not commonly produced utilizing the same model version as is run operationally. These computationally expensive reforecasts are "squeezed out" by operational data assimilation and forecast models that are run at as fine a resolution as possible.
