# Climate Research

Most papers in well-known journals have high-level descriptions of the various methodologies and terminologies used, which I find difficulties sourcing for other simpler forms of explanations and information. This page is therefore to document websites, articles, and videos that I found useful along the way.

## Introduction to Climate Models 
[Carbon Brief: How do climate models work?](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-do-climate-models-work/) <br />
[Carbon Brief: Timeline: The history of climate modelling](https://www.carbonbrief.org/timeline-history-climate-modelling/) <br />
These websites provide a detailed introduction and history to climate models. 

* What is a climate model? 
* What are the different types of climate models?
* What are the inputs and outputs for of a climate model?
* What types of experiments do scientists run on climate models?
* Who does climate modelling around the world?
* What is CMIP?
* How do scientists validate climate models? How do they check them?
* How are climate models “parameterised” and tuned?
* What is bias correction?
* How accurate are climate model projections of temperature?
* What are the main limitations in climate modelling at the moment?
* What is the process for improving models?
* How do scientists produce climate model information for specific regions?
